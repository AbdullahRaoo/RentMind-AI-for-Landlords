# Installation Instructions for RentMind AI for Landlords

## Success! Core Dependencies Installed ✅

The following packages have been successfully installed:
- Django 5.2.4
- All Django channels and websocket support
- All AI/ML packages (langchain, openai, sentence-transformers, etc.)
- All vector database packages (faiss, pymilvus)
- All data processing packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost)

## spaCy Installation Issue on Windows

The only package that failed to install is `spacy` due to Windows compilation issues with the `blis` dependency.

### For Local Windows Development:
You can proceed without spacy for now. Most of your AI functionality will work fine with the other NLP packages already installed.

### For Production/Server Deployment (Linux):
On Linux servers, spacy will install without issues. Simply run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements.txt has been updated with comments explaining this.

## Next Steps:

1. **For Windows Development**: Continue with your project - most features will work
2. **For Production**: Deploy to a Linux server where spacy will install normally
3. **Alternative for Windows**: If you absolutely need spacy locally, consider:
   - Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
   - Using Docker
   - Using a virtual machine with Linux

## Verified Working Packages:
✅ Django and web framework  
✅ OpenAI and LangChain for AI features  
✅ Sentence Transformers for embeddings  
✅ FAISS for vector similarity search  
✅ Milvus for vector database  
✅ XGBoost and scikit-learn for ML  
✅ All data processing tools  

Your project is ready to run with these core dependencies!
